Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming how enterprises operate, but implementing them at scale requires careful consideration of architecture, security, and performance. This guide walks through the essential components of building production-ready LLM applications.

## Key Considerations for Enterprise LLM Applications

### 1. Architecture Design
When designing LLM applications for enterprise use, several key architectural decisions must be made:

- Hosted vs. Self-hosted Models
- Inference Infrastructure
- Data Pipeline Architecture

### 2. Security and Compliance
Enterprise LLM applications require strict security measures:

- Data encryption in transit and at rest
- Access control and authentication
- Audit logging and monitoring
- Compliance with industry regulations

### 3. Performance Optimization
Optimize your LLM application for:

- Batch processing
- Caching strategies
- Resource allocation
- Scaling patterns

### 4. Cost Management
Implement cost control measures:

- Caching frequently requested responses
- Token usage optimization
- Request batching
- Model size selection
